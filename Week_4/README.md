# Midterm Proposal

### Concept
I intend to create a personal portfolio website where I can display my professional skills, projects, and experiences. This site will include sections for showcasing my projects, detailing my skills, presenting my resume, and providing links to my LinkedIn and Tableau profiles to highlight my accomplishments. The website will be designed with user-friendly navigation and a polished appearance.
