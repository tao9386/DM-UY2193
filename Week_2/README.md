### HW Instruction:
- Take a look at a fairly complicated recipe website. Using a tool of your choice, analyze/diagram what their site map and information architecture looks like. Obviously, I donâ€™t expect you to go down to the individual recipe level, but be sure to show how the site you choose breaks down their recipes into categories and at least 1 sub-category.

- Read this article on wireframing. Post a brief reaction in a markdown file in your repo.

- Using the recipe you uploaded last week (or a new one) wireframe your desired layout for a single recipe page on your hypothetical recipe site. Think - rows, columns, sidebars, headers, footers etc. Be sure to mark up each block of content in your wireframe with a few HTML tags for practice.

- Mark up your recipe in HTML semantically based on your wireframe. Bonus points for applying some basic font and color styles.
