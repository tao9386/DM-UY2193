### 3. Recipe Instruction
**Prepare the tofu**: Slice the tofu into pieces that are easy to eat.
**Cook the spices**: Heat oil in a skillet and add the spicy broad bean paste, ginger, and garlic, stirring until they release a rich aroma.
**Incorporate the ground meat**: Add the ground meat to the skillet, frying it until it changes color.
**Introduce the tofu**: Place the tofu chunks into the skillet, mixing gently to avoid crumbling the pieces.
**Flavoring**: Pour a suitable quantity of water into the skillet, adding Sichuan peppercorns, soy sauce, salt, and other spices to taste.
**Thickening**: Near the end of the cooking process, blend in a cornstarch-water mixture to give the sauce a thicker consistency.
**Serving**: Spoon the finished Mapo Tofu into a serving dish, topped with a sprinkling of scallions and a splash of chili oil for that perfect finish.
