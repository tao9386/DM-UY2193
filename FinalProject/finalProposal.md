# Final Proposal

### Concept
In the midterm, I have created an personal portfolio page, where I have the basic strcture for my info. But many web pages are too rough, for example, many buttons have no hover effect. When I click the "contact", "about" buttons on the current page, the page jumps directly instead of sliding down to the button below. Also, the JavaScript pages are very rough. When I click the button, it only changes the text box, not the image along with it. I hope I can improve them by the end of the term. Meanwhile, I hope to add more travel pages. I love traveling, have been to many cities, and I hope to use more web pages to display photos.
